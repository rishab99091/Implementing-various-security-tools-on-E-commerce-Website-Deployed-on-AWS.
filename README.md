# Implementing-various-security-tools-on-E-commerce-Website-Deployed-on-AWS.
This mission objectives to set up an e-trade website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and enforce various safety equipment presented by using AWS to beautify the security and reliability of the website. The task employs a number of AWS offerings which includes Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Access Management, Application Load Balancer, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), Amazon Machine Image (AMI), Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CodeCommit, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Elastic IP, Amazon Inspector, Standardize Tags, CloudFront, and Key Management Service (KMS). The task begins via developing an IAM coverage that limits the variety of allowed EC2 times to improve value-effectiveness and better control sources. The S3 bucket is then granted access to best one legal person, making sure that confidential records is not compromised. The Application Load Balancer is implemented to distribute incoming visitors and maintain excessive availability of the internet site.
The increasing recognition of e-commerce websites has additionally multiplied the danger of cyber threats and attacks, leading to compromised purchaser records and economic losses. The objective of this challenge is to pick out and deal with the security vulnerabilities in an e-commerce website to make sure that client facts and transactions are safe and secure. Also, to put into effect effective security features on a website to save you unauthorized get right of entry to, facts breaches, and cyber-assaults, and to ensure the safety of users' statistics.
Motivations for implementing security on websites are:
1.Protecting sensitive information: Websites often store personal and financial information that can be exploited by hackers if not properly secured. Implementing security measures such as encryption and access control can help protect this information from unauthorized access and data breaches.
Meeting regulatory requirements: Many industries have specific regulations that require websites to meet certain security standards. For example, websites that handle credit card information must comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
Building trust with customers: Customers are more likely to trust websites that have strong security measures in place. Implementing security measures can help build trust with customers and improve the reputation of the website.
Preventing downtime and loss of revenue: Cyber attacks can cause websites to go down, resulting in loss of revenue and damage to the reputation of the website. Implementing security measures can help prevent these types of attacks and ensure the website remains operational.
Protecting intellectual property: Websites may contain valuable intellectual property that needs to be protected from theft or unauthorized access. Implementing security measures can help protect this intellectual property and ensure it remains confidential.
Implementing MFA
MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication, that's a protection mechanism that requires users to offer or more sorts of authentication in an effort to get right of entry to a machine or application. This extra layer of protection helps prevent unauthorized get admission to and might shield touchy facts. By imposing MFA we were given the subsequent consequences:
•Increased safety: MFA presents an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password, making it greater tough for hackers to advantage get right of entry to to structures or packages.
•Protects towards password robbery: MFA helps defend in opposition to password robbery or phishing attacks, as an attacker could want get right of entry to to the additional authentication method (which includes a mobile device or hardware token) similarly to the person's password.
